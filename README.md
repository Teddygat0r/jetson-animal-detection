NextJS Frontend is stored within the Frontend Folder
Backend is stored within the server folder.

There are two sections to it, the flask server is within the /server/flask folder.
Run the flask server before starting the ML program within /server/model.py.

Make sure all dependencies are installed.
The model also isn't included within the repo, you need to download it yourself and put it within the /server/models/ folder.
You can download the final version of our [model here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVVhv5Ynur0ULXc2WjB0p93Q8EI-d9ev/view).
